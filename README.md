## Hi there 👋 

I’m Nate Rengo — a Computer Science and Mathematics graduate from Western Colorado University (’25) and a Private Pilot.
I love building tools that solve real problems and exploring topics like AI, cryptography, and systems automation.
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me trail running or backcountry skiing in the Colorado mountains.

🧠 Tech I use: Python, Java, C++, SQL, JavaScript, Flask, HTML/CSS, Azure/Entra, Jamf, Active Directorym MECM

✈️ Always learning, building, and exploring.

Outside of academics I am an avid mountain athlete. I am a trail runnner on one of the only Collegiate trail running teams in the country! I have been fortunate to race all across the Western United States as well as a 50 mile race in my hometown in Minnesota. In the winter you'll find me backcountry skiing and recreating. I hope to have the opportunitiy to work with a company that is making a real difference in the world and look forward to the opportunitiy to learn more in whatever comes next after graduation.
