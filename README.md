## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nate Rengo! I will be graduating from Western Colorado University in May of 2025 with a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science. Throughout my academic career at Western I have been fortunate to gain experience in numerous programming languages such as: Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript, C, C++, Python Flask, HTML, CSS, R, and Git. Through the Math side I have gained experience in Cryptography along with the other general math course such as proofs and the Calculus sequence. 

Outside of academics I am an avid mountain athlete. I am a trail runnner on one of the only Collegiate trail running teams in the country! I have been fortunate to race all across the Western United States as well as a 50 mile race in my hometown in Minnesota. In the winter you'll find me backcountry skiing and recreating. I hope to have the opportunitiy to work with a company that is making a real difference in the world and look forward to the opportunitiy to learn more in whatever comes next after graduation.
